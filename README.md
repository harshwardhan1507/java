## 📌 Overview

Welcome to the **Java Knowledge Base**! This repository is a structured educational resource and reference vault documenting core Java programming concepts, from basic syntax up to multi-threaded concurrency, object-oriented design patterns, and interactive mini-projects.

It is structured to serve dual roles:
1. **IntelliJ Developer Workspace:** Highly organized under the unified root namespace `javakb`.
2. **Obsidian Knowledge Vault:** Direct integration with concept notes organized separately inside the `docs/` folder, linking directly to source codes.

## 🧠 Obsidian Vault Setup

This project is optimized to be used as an **Obsidian Knowledge Vault**. To set up the vault locally:

1. **Download Obsidian:** Download and install Obsidian from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) (free, cross-platform).
2. **Open Vault:** Launch Obsidian, select **"Open folder as vault"**, and choose the [docs/](docs/) directory specifically (do not select the repository root folder).
   * **Why only `docs/`?** This ensures Obsidian only indexes the markdown concept notes and ignores raw Java source code or build folders. Notes can still link to code folder paths relatively (`../../src/`), but your Obsidian vault environment remains clean and focused solely on note-taking.
3. **Core Plugins Recommended:**
   * **Graph View:** Turn this on to visualize how different Java chapters, DSA concepts, and projects connect with each other.
   * **Outline / Bookmarks:** Helpful for navigating long concept sheets.
   * **Tags Pane:** Displays properties and tags configured across notes.
   
*Note: All files are standard GitHub-Flavored Markdown. Relative links and formatting will render correctly directly on GitHub, but features like interactive graphs and visual canvas boards are best experienced inside Obsidian.*

## 🛠️ IntelliJ Setup & Compilation

To run the examples in this repository using IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Import the root `java-knowledge-base` folder into IntelliJ.
2. Mark the `src` folder as the **Sources Root** (Right-click `src` $\rightarrow$ *Mark Directory As* $\rightarrow$ *Sources Root*).
3. If packages show errors, run a project build/reindex (*Build* $\rightarrow$ *Rebuild Project*).

### Manual Compilation from Command Line
Because the code uses the base namespace package `javakb`, compile and run from the root folder:

```bash
# Compile a chapter file
javac -d out -sourcepath src src/javakb/ch07_oop/ClassesAndObjects.java

# Run the compiled file
java -cp out javakb.ch07_oop.ClassesAndObjects
```

## 🔮 Future Roadmap & Expansion

This repository is built to scale into these domains, combining ongoing expansions and planned modules:
* **DSA ([docs/dsa/](docs/dsa/)):** Expanding from complexity analysis into core Data Structures (Arrays, LinkedLists, Trees, Graphs) & Algorithmic paradigms.
* **Design Patterns ([docs/design_patterns/](docs/design_patterns/)):** Documenting Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns (structure initiated).
* **Advanced Java (`src/javakb/advanced_java/`):** Advanced stream APIs, Lambdas, JVM profiling.
* **JDBC (`src/javakb/jdbc/`):** Database integration patterns.
* **Spring Boot ([docs/spring_boot/](docs/spring_boot/)):** REST API creation and enterprise configurations.
